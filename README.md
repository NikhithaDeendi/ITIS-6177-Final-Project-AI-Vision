You can achieve the same result using CLI with the help of [cURL](https://curl.se/) like this:
```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://159.65.225.73:3000/generate-caption' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'image=@/Users/aravind/Downloads/cat_compressed.gif;type=image/gif'
```
Just make sure to change the image path to that in your system and modify the type accordingly.

### Sample Response
